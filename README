cfcounter
=========

Cfcounter is a tool to count the number of rows in a column family for Cassandra


Motivation
----------
- Fast and easy tool to get an accurate count for a column family in Cassandra
- Serves as a quick exercise to familiarize myself with the Dispatcher pattern described in http://marcio.io/2015/07/handling-1-million-requests-per-minute-with-golang/
- Play around with the awesome termui library
